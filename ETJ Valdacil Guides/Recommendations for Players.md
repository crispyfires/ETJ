Coming Soon

Notes to Add:
- Review ETJ Readme and Gameplay Guide to become familiar with content
- Review MCM to familiarize yourself with mods that might affect gameplay
- If unsure about how a mod works or interacts, find the mod on Nexus and review the mod page and posts
- ETJ contains thousands of mod, while the team can provide support for the list as a whole, support for individual mods may be better received on the mod page for that mod
- Create Configs mod to collect all config files
