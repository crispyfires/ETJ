        Legacy of the Dragonborn has numerous quests and events which occur when certain Display counts are met. However, you can change the trigger display count in the MCM. In this spreadsheet, select the Display Marker you selected in the MCM and column B will update to show at what Display count each event unlocks. Pick Start from the dropdown when a quest is started and Comp when complete.

        Legacy of the Dragonborn has displays in the Safehouse which are not populated by the Display Prep Station and are not tracked in The Curator's Companion.  This checklist includes the Safehouse Misc cabinet, dishes cabinet, silver cabinet, dwemer cabinet, raw and cooked food, alcohol, and Cheesemod.  Also included are Cloaks of Skyrim (which has hooks in the closet in the Safehouse) and Autographs even though both are tracked by TCC and sort via the Display Prep Station.
