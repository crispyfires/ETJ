| [LotD Quests and Events Guide](LotD Quests and Events.ods) | Legacy of the Dragonborn has numerous quests and events which occur when certain Display counts are met.  However, you can change the trigger display count in the MCM. In this spreadsheet, select the Display Marker you selected in the MCM and column B will update to show at what Display count each event unlocks.  Pick Start from the dropdown when a quest is started and Comp when complete. |
